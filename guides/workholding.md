# Workholding

Choosing the correct mode of workholding is critical to effectively machining parts. Choosing an incorrect mode of workholding can lead to ruined parts, out-of-tolerance parts, marred parts, aircutting, or worst case scenario, even machine crashes. With that being said, getting an idea of the situations in which to use different modes of workholding is critical to becoming a good machinist.

This guide will be a brief overview of the types of workholding we using for the Datron, because most of the intuition will come from hands-on experience and learning.

## Vacuum Bed

The Datron has the privilege having a very handy type of workholding in its vacuum bed. The table creates a large amount of suction between the vacuum holes and the part, creating a solid seal that will hold the part in place. Some issues arise from this mode, for instance, if the face you choose to seal to the bed is not flat, the seal will not be solid and the part can move. Or if the stock is not large enough to create a solid seal, the vacuum bed will not hold it.

For most parts you will encounter, the vacuum bed will suffice.

## Superglue Fixture

For some of the smaller parts you will have to machine, the vacuum bed will not suffice. It's a bit troublesome to work around a vise, so we use this little trick that involves superglue. The idea is that you can vacuum a large piece of plastic to hold on the bed, and then apply a layer of tape to the plastic and the stock and then superglue the taped faces together.

This way we preserve some elements of the vacuum bed, such as being able to cut the full height of the stock, while being able to hold small or oddly-shaped stocks.
