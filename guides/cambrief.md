# A Brief Overview of CAM

## What is CAM?
- CAM stands for "Computer-Aided Manufacturing". CNC Machines process their movements and actions through a (non-standardized) language called G-Code, which for the most part is a letter followed by a string of numbers. As someone programming toolpaths and other actions that the machine needs to follow, this is extremely inconvenient, as it requires the programmer to memorize or lookup codes in order to write a singular program, all without synchronous visual aid or simulation of their toolpath.
