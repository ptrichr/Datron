# A Brief Overview of CAM

## What is CAM?
CAM stands for "Computer-Aided Manufacturing". CNC Machines execute their movements and actions by reading a (non-standardized) language called G-Code, which for the most part is a letter followed by a string of numbers that tells the machine to perform a specific action at a specific location. As someone programming toolpaths and other actions that the machine needs to follow, this is extremely inconvenient, as it requires the programmer to memorize or lookup codes in order to write a singular program, all without synchronous visual aid or simulation of their toolpath. CAM is an abstraction of G-code programming that makes the process mostly visual. Toolpaths are visually programmed in a method similar to computer design process, allowing you to program various complex operations without looking up a single G-code. CAM softwares also have simulations and toolpath visualization as aids for programming. These toolpath directives will be later compiled by a post-processor into G-code that the machine can read. In the IFL we use Autodesk Fusion360 CAM.
