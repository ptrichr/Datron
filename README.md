# Terrapin Works Datron Training

Hi! If you're here that means you're training to become a Datron operator - that's great!

> [!CAUTION]
> If you haven't completed your capstone or the IFL technician trainings turn back now! They are prerequistites for operating the Datron.

This training is formatted into modules, making the ingestion of content easier. Your first task will be to read these guides:

[I. Introduction to CAM](/guides/cambrief.md)

[II. Introduction to the Machine](/guides/introduction.md)

[III. Tooling](/guides/tooling.md)

After you've read the guides above, clone these blank designs into your user training folder in fusion from: Datron-Projects/!Training/Example-Orders:

- [ ] 2068
- [ ] Titan 9M
- [ ] `//TBD`
- [ ] 2481

After you've cloned them, try to do the CAM yourself before referring to the corresponding ELMS-Canvas module for each part. Have a MS or any other Datron operator look over your CAM as well as we might be able to give helpful advice or tips.
